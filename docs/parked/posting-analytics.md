# Parked: Posting analytics

## What it did

A photographer could open the Analytics page to see how often they posted to Instagram over a chosen date range — as a frequency chart (daily, weekly, or monthly buckets), a day-of-week × hour heatmap, and caption/hashtag aggregates (top hashtags, average caption length, and similar summary stats). The Insights home showed a mini frequency chart for the last twelve months and linked the “Posted to Instagram” KPI to that page. A separate panel listed catalog images not yet marked posted (`instagram_posted = 0`), filterable by date, rating, and month. All of this drew from **validated matches** only: rows in `instagram_dump_media` joined to `matches` where `validated_at IS NOT NULL`, with event time from `created_at` or a `date_folder` fallback.

## Why it was retired

Analytics is also not worth it anymore. Structurally, the feature read only `instagram_dump_media ⋈ matches WHERE validated_at IS NOT NULL`, so it could not have survived the Instagram dump-import removal regardless of preference. No per-query cost, precision threshold, or population size for analytics was measured or recorded in the repo.

## To revive this, one of these would have to change

- The Instagram dump import and validated-match pipeline would need to return (or be replaced by another source of confirmed Instagram post timestamps and captions tied to catalog images).
- Posting cadence would need a data source that does not depend on `instagram_dump_media` — for example, a maintained export API, manual post-date entry at scale, or syncing from a platform that outlives the dump workflow.
- If the judgement stands on usefulness alone, nothing would revive it; the retirement was not only a dependency issue.
