# Context: Visualizer (TypeScript API + React UI)

## Purpose

The visualizer is the web product that surfaces library data to the user. It consists of a Hono backend (`apps/visualizer/backend/`) and a React SPA (`apps/visualizer/frontend/`). They are developed and deployed together — backend and frontend share the same domain model and API contracts. The backend also carries the library itself (catalog reader, vision pipeline, CLIP, scoring) and the `lightroom-tagger` CLI; there is no separate library package.

## Domain language

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **job** | A background task (e.g. score images, generate descriptions, build catalog cache). Stored in `visualizer.db`. Has a lifecycle: `pending → running → completed / failed / cancelled`. |
| **job runner** | `JobRunner` in `jobs/runner.ts` — coordinates job lifecycle, progress hooks and cancellation. Handlers poll `runner.isCancelled(jobId)`; there is no thread-local DB, because handlers run on the event loop over one connection. |
| **job processor** | `jobs/processor.ts` — started at app startup, drains the job queue and dispatches to handlers. |
| **handler** | A function in `jobs/handlers/` (one module per job family) that implements a specific job type (e.g. `handleBatchDescribe`, `handleBatchStackDetect`). |
| **job-type registry** | `jobs/registry.ts` — explicit `JOB_TYPES` list co-locating handler, catalog requirement, and checkpoint helpers per type. Single registration surface; mirrors ADR-0006. See ADR-0010. |
| **job transitions seam** | `jobs/transitions.ts` — pure cancel/retry status legality and `updateJobStatus` targets. Routes delegate via `transitionCancel` / `transitionRetry`; no status-rule literals in `api/jobs.ts`. See ADR-0010. |
| **checkpoint** | Persisted job progress snapshot merged into job metadata so interrupted jobs can resume. |
| **emit_progress** | SocketIO callback passed into job runner and handlers to push real-time progress to the frontend. |
| **visualizer DB** | `visualizer.db` — SQLite database holding jobs, logs, and visualizer-specific state. Separate from `library.db`. |
| **library DB** | `library.db` — the shared library database (images, scores, descriptions), read and written through `db/library/`. Legacy Instagram-matching data lives in `instagram-matching-export.json` beside the DB ([#228](https://github.com/ccanalesb/lightroom-tagger/issues/228)). |
| **library-DB lifecycle seam** | Job handlers open `library.db` via `withLibraryDb` in `jobs/handlers/common.ts`; never hand-roll `initLibraryDb(...)` + manual `close()` in handler bodies. See ADR-0011. |
| **route group** | An `OpenAPIHono` router under `apps/visualizer/backend/src/api/`, mounted in `app.ts`. One per domain area (jobs, images, descriptions, providers, scores, identity, system). Successor to the Flask blueprint, and the mount prefixes are unchanged. |
| **response helpers** | `utils/responses.ts` — `errorNotFound`, `errorBadRequest`, `successPaginated`, etc. Always use these for consistent JSON shapes. |
| **WebSocket / SocketIO** | Real-time job progress pushed from backend to frontend via socket.io + socket.io-client. |
| **perspective** | Named scoring lens shown in the UI (matches the library concept). |
| **model-scoped re-do** (`redo_unless_model`) | A batch describe/score mode that regenerates every eligible image *except* those whose current row was produced by the named target model, which it preserves. Lets a model-swap backlog run over many throttled cycles without redoing the target model's own finished work. Overrides blanket `force`. |
| **identity** | Photographer style fingerprint and suggestions page (`IdentityPage.tsx`). Catalog-only candidate pool ([#218](https://github.com/ccanalesb/lightroom-tagger/issues/218)); Advisor `high_score_unposted` / `eligible_unposted` key off manually set `instagram_posted` (see [#205](https://github.com/ccanalesb/lightroom-tagger/issues/205)). |
| **description search** | Keyword filter on the Images page (`CatalogTab` / `description_search` → FTS5 over `image_descriptions`); not the retired chat Search page. |
| **instagram_posted** | Catalog flag: user marks a photo as posted to Instagram in `ImageDetailModal`. Advisor and catalog `posted` filters read the column only — not derived from Instagram dump rows ([#218](https://github.com/ccanalesb/lightroom-tagger/issues/218)). |

The Images page is catalog-only in the UI ([#225](https://github.com/ccanalesb/lightroom-tagger/issues/225)). Instagram gallery, match review, dump import, vision matching, and describe/score/embed over dump media were removed; see `docs/parked/instagram-matching.md`.

## Key files

### Backend

| File | Role |
|---|---|
Paths are relative to `apps/visualizer/backend/src/`.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `app.ts` | `createApp()` factory — mounts the route groups, CORS and the OpenAPI document |
| `server.ts` | Process entry point — binds the port, attaches SocketIO, starts the job processor |
| `config.ts` | Env-var getters (`LIBRARY_DB`, `FLASK_PORT`, `OLLAMA_HOST`, …) plus the `config.yaml` loader |
| `db/jobs/` | Visualizer DB schema and helpers (jobs, logs, checkpoints) |
| `db/library/` | Every `library.db` read and write, one module per table family; `bootstrap.ts` owns the schema |
| `jobs/runner.ts` | `JobRunner` — lifecycle, cancellation, progress hooks |
| `jobs/registry.ts` | Explicit `JOB_TYPES` registry — dispatch, catalog requirement, checkpoint co-location |
| `jobs/handlers/` | Per-job-family handler modules (`analyze`, `embed`, `stacks`, …) |
| `jobs/transitions.ts` | Pure cancel/retry state machine (`transitionCancel`, `transitionRetry`) |
| `jobs/checkpoint.ts` | Checkpoint merge logic |
| `api/jobs.ts` | REST endpoints for job CRUD and cancellation (zod + OpenAPI — ADR-0013) |
| `api/images/` | Catalog and stack image route groups (`catalog`, `stacks`, `frame-substance`) |
| `api/descriptions.ts` | Description fetch/trigger endpoints |
| `api/scores.ts` | Score endpoints per image/perspective |
| `api/identity.ts` | Identity/suggestions endpoints |
| `api/providers.ts` | Provider availability endpoints |
| `api/system.ts` | Health, config, system info |
| `api/schemas/` | zod request/response models, one module per group |
| `websocket/` | SocketIO event handlers |
| `utils/responses.ts` | Shared JSON response helpers |
| `cli/` | The `lightroom-tagger` CLI — `scan`, `sync`, `search`, `export`, `init`, `stats`, `enrich-catalog` |
| `lightroom/` | `.lrcat` reader, keyword writer and the catalog sync driver |
| `imaging/`, `vision/`, `providers/`, `analyzer/`, `identity/`, `clip/` | The library layer: RAW decode, CLIP, phash, vision calls, scoring, identity |

### Frontend

| File / Dir | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/App.tsx` | Route definitions (React Router 6) |
| `src/pages/` | Page components: Dashboard, Images, Processing, Identity |
| `src/components/` | Shared UI components |
| `src/services/` | API client (`api.ts`) and WebSocket service |
| `src/hooks/` | Custom hooks (e.g. `useJobSocket` — invalidates `jobs.list` on server-emitted `job_created`) |
| `src/stores/` | Zustand stores (minimal — mainly WebSocket state) |
| `src/constants/` | UI strings and other constants |
| `src/types/` | Shared TypeScript types generated from backend OpenAPI (`api.gen.ts`, ADR-0013); thin per-group re-exports |

The server emits `job_created` on job creation (`POST /jobs`); `useJobSocket` owns the resulting `jobs.list` invalidation. No component hand-bubbles a job-list-refresh callback (e.g. an `onJobEnqueued` prop) outside `useJobSocket` — refresh-on-enqueue is driven by the server's `job_created` event. No component subscribes to job socket events (`job_created` / `job_updated` / `jobs_recovered`) outside `useJobSocket`. Per-job `subscribe_job` / `unsubscribe_job` emits are the one allowed exception (job-instance scoped, not fan-out).

## Architectural constraints

- **Frontend and backend are one unit**: changes to API shape must be reflected in both the backend route group and the frontend service layer.
- **SocketIO for job progress**: never poll for job status — use the WebSocket channel.
- **Always use `utils/responses.ts` helpers**: never return a raw `c.json(...)` with an ad-hoc status code from a route.
- **Cancellation is polled, not thrown**: handlers check `runner.isCancelled(jobId)` between units of work and pass a `cancelCheck` down; there is no thread-local cancel scope.
- **Dev proxy**: Vite proxies `/api` and `/socket.io` to `localhost:5001`; don't hardcode backend URLs in frontend code.
- **Design system**: all UI work must follow `apps/visualizer/frontend/DESIGN.md` (Tailwind semantic classes, 8px grid, Inter font, single blue accent).
- **Job-type knowledge through `JOB_TYPES` only** (ADR-0010): dispatch (`getJobHandler`), catalog gating (`jobTypesRequiringCatalog`) and checkpoint helpers are registry projections — no second handler map or catalog set.
- **Job status transitions through `jobs/transitions.ts` only** (ADR-0010): `api/jobs.ts` delegates cancel/retry to `transitionCancel` / `transitionRetry`; no cancellable/retryable status sets or `updateJobStatus` targets in routes.
- **Library-DB lifecycle through `withLibraryDb` only** (ADR-0011): handler orchestration goes through the helper in `jobs/handlers/common.ts`; no hand-rolled `initLibraryDb(...)` + manual `close()`.
- **API contract seam — backend-authoritative OpenAPI** (ADR-0013): All API response shapes are zod schemas registered on their route; frontend types are generated from OpenAPI (`npm run generate:api` → `src/types/api.gen.ts`); drift is gated in CI (see `.sandcastle/ci-drift-gate.yml`). `frontend/src/services/api.ts` must not declare hand-written response interfaces.

The last four were each enforced by a Python guardrail test that read the Flask
tree with `ast`, and those went with it. Two are now structural instead: the
registry is the only thing typed to hold a handler, and `withLibraryDb` is the
only export that hands out a connection. The other two are conventions until
something replaces the guardrails
([#306](https://github.com/ccanalesb/lightroom-tagger/issues/306)).
