/**
 * The background job processor. Port of the `_job_processor` loop, the watchdog
 * and the orphan recovery in `app.py`.
 *
 * Structural difference from Python, and it removes a whole class of bug: the
 * Python loop ran on a `threading.Thread` restarted by a watchdog, and
 * `/_processor_health` had to guess which *module instance* held the heartbeat —
 * running `python app.py` registered the server under `__main__` while the
 * blueprint imported a second copy as `app`, so snapshotting the wrong one
 * reported a live processor as dead. Here the loop is an async interval in the one
 * process, and the heartbeat is a module-level object with a single instance.
 *
 * The watchdog survives in spirit: `tick` never throws, and a thrown error is
 * recorded on the heartbeat as `last_error` rather than killing the loop.
